# Surrogate modeling and Robust Optimization

Here, the objective was to find a way to minimize the maximum take-off weight `MTOW` of $g:x\mapsto g(x, u)=f(x,u)$. with $x$ the deign parameters, $u$ the technological parameters and $f$ the airplane model.
We want to use robust optimization to prove that hydrogen airplane could achieve A320 performances even in the worst case scenario of technological advancements represented by technological parameters $u$.
