# Surrogate modeling and optimization

Here, the objective was to create a surrogate model of $g:x\mapsto g(x)=f(x,u_{\mathrm{default}})$
to approximate the objective and constraints of the design problem
with respect to the design parameters $x$.
Then, this surrogate model is used in an optimization process
to minimize the objective whilst ensuring the constraints
by varying the design parameters.
